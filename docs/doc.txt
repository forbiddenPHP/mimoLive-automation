General
The API, when enabled, is available at “http://localhost:8989/api/v1”. This is the base URL that must be prepended to every method URL listed below.

If a resource was introduced after the initial launch of the HTTP API, the method is marked with an Available since information.

/

Supported methods: “GET”
Redirects to the list of open documents at “/documents”.

/devices

Supported methods: “GET”
Returns a list of currently available video devices on the host system. Each entry contains an identifier and human-readable name. Useful for mapping capture devices to Sources.

/devices/(DeviceID)

Supported methods: “GET”
Returns details for the device specified by “(DeviceID)”, including its name and properties.

Documents
Querying Documents
/documents

Supported methods: “GET”
Results in a list of open documents. See the documents data type on what information the returned objects contain.

/documents/(DocumentID)

Supported methods: “GET”
Returns a single document specified by the “(DocumentID)”. In the included section of the response all “layer” objects used by this document and all “source” objects contained in this document will be returned as well (sideloading). See the documents data type for more information on the data returned.

/documents/(DocumentID)/programOut

Supported methods: “GET”
The program output that is currently produced by the document specified by the “(DocumentID)”.
Takes the same parameters as source previews.

Document Actions
/documents/(DocumentID)/setLive

Supported methods: “GET” “POST”
Starts a show/document and triggers all asociated events. Calling this on an already running document will not result in an error. The updated document object will be returned.

/documents/(DocumentID)/setOff

Supported methods: “GET” “POST”
Stops a show/document. Calling this on an already stopped show will not result in an error. The updated document object will be returned.

*Because a document can decide to keep running after you call this method the returned layer object might be in state “shutdown” instead of “off”.

/documents/(DocumentID)/toggleLive

Supported methods: “GET” “POST”
Toggles a show/document between live and off.

Layers
Querying Layers
/documents/(DocumentID)/layers

Supported methods: “GET”
Returns a list of layers for the document specified by “(DocumentID)”. For information on the objects returned see the layers data type.

/documents/(DocumentID)/layers/(LayerID)

Supported methods: “GET”, “PUT”
Returns a single layer specified by the “(LayerID)” in the document specified by “(DocumentID)”. In the “included” section of the response all “variant” objects related to this layer will be returned as well (sideloading). See the layers data type for more information on the data returned. Please keep in mind that the “input-values” from the layer endpoint reflect the “input-values” of the associated “liveVariant” variant.

Modifying a Layer
Supported methods: “GET”, “PUT”
To set the name of the layer, audio volume or input values perform a “PUT” request with a JSON encoded object to the layer endpoint. Alternatively you can use a “GET” request by adding the JSON data to the URL with the key “?update=”. In this case the JSON data must be URL encoded.

Values you don’t want to change should be simply excluded from the JSON data. Example:

{
    "name": "New name of the Layer",
    "volume": 0.5,
    "input-values": { 
        "tvGroup_Content__Subtitle": "This is a Test"
    }
}
After updating the values mimoLive will respond with an updated layer object. Keep in mind that not all values can be applied instantly or might only have an effect after another render cycle.

Note: The “volume” attribute has been added in mimoLive 5.6 and is ignored in earlier versions or if the layer has no volume control. Value will be clipped to (0, 1), where 0 is silent and 1 is full volume.

Layer Actions
/documents/(DocumentID)/layers/(LayerID)/setLive

Supported methods: “GET” “POST”
Activates a layer, when this is called directly on the layer, the last selected layer variant will be used. Calling this on an already active layer will not result in an error. The updated layer object will be returned.

/documents/(DocumentID)/layers/(LayerID)/setOff

Supported methods: “GET” “POST”
Deactivates a layer. Calling this on an already deactivated layer will not result in an error. The updated layer object will be returned.

*Because a layer can decide to do some animations after you call this method the returned layer object might be in state “shutdown” instead of “off”.

/documents/(DocumentID)/layers/(LayerID)/toggleLive

Supported methods: “GET” “POST”
Toggles a layer between “live” and “off”.

/documents/(DocumentID)/layers/(LayerID)/signals/(SignalID)

Supported methods: “GET” “POST”
Triggers the signal specified by “(SignalID)” in the current “live-variant” or if the layer is not live in the “active-variant”. You can get the “(SignalID)” from the “input-values” field of the layer (identified by the key suffix “_TypeSignal”).

/documents/(DocumentID)/layers/(LayerID)/cycleThroughVariants

Supported methods: “GET” “POST”
Available since: mimoLive 5.6
Selects the next variant after the currently active variant of layer “(LayerID)” to be the layer’s new active variant. This can be used to select the variant (e.g. of a Lower Third Layer) that should go live next.
Calling this endpoint does not disturb your show if the layer is currently live. The effect only shows when the layer is set live afterwards.

/documents/(DocumentID)/layers/(LayerID)/cycleThroughVariantsBackwards

Supported methods: “GET” “POST”
Selects the previous variant (the inverse of /cycleThroughVariants) without affecting the current live state. Effect becomes visible when the layer or selected variant is set live.

}
Output Destination Actions
/documents/(DocumentID)/output-destinations/(OutputDestinationID)/setLive

Supported methods: “GET” “POST”
Causes the output destination specified by “(OutputDestinationID)” to go live, if it is properly configured and the allowed to go live (e.g. based on the mimoLive licensing state).
If the output destination is able to go live, the output destination with its new “live-state” is returned, otherwise a “409 Conflict” error is returned.

*Because an output destination may need to perform some work before being live (e.g. contacting an external service to create a live stream), the returned output destination object may be in state “startup” instead of “live”.

/documents/(DocumentID)/output-destinations/(OutputDestinationID)/setOff

Supported methods: “GET” “POST”
Causes the output destination specified by “(OutputDestinationID)” to stop.
If the output destination is allowed to stop, the output destination is returned, otherwise a “409 Conflict” error is returned.

*Because an output destination may need to perform some work before stopping operations, the returned output destination may be in state “shutdown” instead of “preview” (which would be the default for a well-configured output destination).

Layer Sets
Layer sets were introduced in mimoLive 5.0 and allow setting the live state of multiple layers at once, enabling the creation of lightweight scenes for different situations in a show. They can only be created and manged in mimoLive. API access is restricted to obtaining and recalling (activating) layer sets.

Querying Layer Sets
/documents/(DocumentID)/layer-sets

textileRef:9996801466400ba8908856:linkStartMarker:“Supported methods: “GET”
Available since: mimoLive 5.0
Lists all layer sets for the specified document.
For information on the objects returned see the ““layer-sets” data type”:{TOPIC-LINK+data-typesh1(}. section-layer-sets).

/documents/(DocumentID)/layer-sets/(LayerSetID)

Supported methods: “GETtextileRef:9996801466400ba8908856:linkStartMarker:”
Returns the layer set specified by “(LayerSetID)”.
For information on the objects returned see the ““layer-sets” data type”:{TOPIC-LINK+data-typesh1(}. section-layer-sets).

Layer Set Actions
/documents/(DocumentID)/layer-sets/(LayerSetID)/recall

Supported methods: “GET” “POST”
Recalls (activates) the layer set specified by “(LayerSetID)”, causing all layers to assume the live state recorded in the layer set.
Returns the layer set after recalling, i.e. with “active == true”.

Data Stores
/documents/(DocumentID)/datastores/(StoreID)

Supported methods: “GET”, “PUT”, “DELETE”
mimoLive offers the ability to store data you provide inside the document file, for example to restore a state at a later time. You are free to choose a “StoreID” yourself, but be aware that there is no way to list all data stores associated with a document (however, you may create some kind of index store that keeps track of your other, dynamically named stores).

Create/Update a data store

To create or update a data store send a “PUT” request to a “StoreID” of your choice with the associated data in the body of your request. If the operation was successfull mimoLive will respond with a “200 OK” status.

Read contents of a data store

To read a previously stored data store simple request it via “GET”. The data will be returned exactly as you provided it in the “PUT” request to store it. If no data store with that ID was found for this document mimoLive will return a “404 Not Found” error.

Delete an existing data store

To delete a data store when you no longer need it simply issue an “DELETE” request for the “StoreID” you want to delete. In the event that the data store was not there in the first place mimoLive will respond with a “404 Not Found” error.

Data Types
Table of Contents
Reducing the API responds with Sparse Filtering
If the API responds is too much data, you can narrow down which data you what to get back by Sparse Filtering. For sparse Filtering you have two fields that will help you with this:

– “include=,” will describe which categories of the JSON responds should be included. You can specify multiple paths separated by commas.
– “field[]=,” will describe which values should be included of that specific category. You can have multiple field definitions to specify different values for each category.

Example: You want to read out if a certain File Recording Output Destination is currently recording or not. In this case we are interested in the “live-state” value of the “attributes” category in the root category “data”. This means we need to specify the include category path as “data.attributes”. The “attributes” category contains multiple values but we just want to see the “live-state” in the responds thats why we narrow it down by the “fields[attributes]=live-state”

This makes up the following curl command: (Please make sure to replace the and with your own values!)

curl "http://192.168.0.107:8989/api/v1/documents//output-destinations/?include=data.attributes&amp;fields[attributes]=live-state"
The responds will look like this:

{"data":{"attributes":{"live-state":"preview"}}}
Documents
The “documents” type corresponds to the document object that mimoLive writes to disk as “.tvshow” files.

    "volume": Float | null,
    // The inputs used for the layer (composition). The keys come directly from the underlying QuartzComposition.

    // The index of the layer in the layer stack (zero relates to the top of the stack)
    "index": Integer 
  }
}
*The “volume” attribute has been added in mimoLive 5.2.

Variants
The “variants” type models one instance of a layer configuration. Most layers will only ever have one variant, but for some layers (e.g. Lower Thirds), it is common to have multiple variants featuring different text contents.
Variants share a lot of information with the “layers” type. In fact, a layer mostly acts as a proxy to its currently active variant.

{
  // Unique identifier of the variant
  "id": String,
  // Always "variants" (see the JSON-API documentation for more information on this field)
  "type": "variants",
  // See the JSON:API specification for more information on this field
  "relationships": {
    // The layer this variant belongs to
    "layer": Relationship
  },
  // The link to the resource itself (see the JSON:API specification for more information on this field)
  "links": Object,

Individual Settings

Different output destination types have different settings.
Below are the different types of “settings” object. For output destinations types that are not listed, the dictionary will be empty.

{
  // Path to the folder that will contain the recording. Can be set to "null" to reset to initial value ("~/Movies').
  "location": String,
  // Filename that will be given to the recording. See below for placeholder values. Can be set to "null" to reset to initial value ("%document %year-%month-%day %hour-%minute-%second.%extension").
  "filename": String
}
{
  // Available since: mimoLive 5.5:
  // Ofuscated URL of the streaming endpoint.
  "rtmpurl": String,
  // Ofuscated steaming key.
  "streamingkey": String,
   // Public broadcast URL.
  "publicurl": String
}
*
Even that the “rtmpurl” and “streamingkey” values are obfuscated you still can set those values by a PATCH request.

Placeholder values for File Recording’s “filename” attribute

Placeholder	Explanation
%document	name of the document including the .tvshow extension (depending on user system settings)
%show	name of the show
%extension	mov, without the . prefix
%year	4 digit year, e.g. 2018

    // Wheter the layer stack currently matches the configuration represented by the layer set
    "active": Bool
  }
} 
Live State
The “LiveState” type represents the state a document, layer or variant can be in. Possible values are:

Value	Explanation
off	Layer: The layer is off and will not be rendered.
 	Document: The show is not running.
 	Output Destination: The output destination is not able to go live because it is not properly configured.
live	Layer: The layer is live and will be rendered, on a variant this means that the layer is live and the variant is live.
 	Document: The show is currently running.
 	Output Destination: The output destination is active and transmitting/recording data.
preview	Layer: The layer is displayed in the preview column and may be switched live soon.
 	Output Destination: The output destination is ready to go live and waiting for commands.
shutdown	Layer: The layer is currently live but is in the process of shutting down (e. g. an outgoing transition).
startup	Output Destination: The output destination is in the process of starting (e.g. connecting to an external service).
TallyState
A “TallyState” represents the state a source can be in. The degree of activity is ordered and only the highest use will be reported. Possible values (from low to high) are:

Value	Explanation
off	The source is currently not in use by mimoLive
in-use	The source is currently being used somewhere inside mimoLive
effect	The source is currently used for being rendered in an filter preview
preview	The source is currently used inside the preview output
program	The source is currently used inside the program output
